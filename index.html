      <h2>Why the name Blue Sky Work and Blue Sky SaaS</h2>
      <p>12 years ago I started my first company focusing on helping organizations achieve more with smart and effective use of technology. I named my company Blue Sky Consulting basing it on the concept of blue-sky thinking, <em>meaning a thinking that is not limited by the realities of the present; open-minded thinking</em>.</p>
