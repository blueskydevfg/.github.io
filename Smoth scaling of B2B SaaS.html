		<h2>Leverage proven Product & Engineering experience to mitigate risks and ensure smooth scaling</h2>
		  <p>
			Early-stage <strong>B2B SaaS</strong> companies are on an exciting jounrey. <strong>Fueled by</strong> deep domain <strong>knowledge and passion</strong> from the founders, they are also often <strong>unstructured and lacking the experience</strong> to drive functional excellence in <strong>product & engineering</strong>. This introduces <strong>risks</strong> when growing and <strong>prevents smooth scaling</strong> of the organization and processes past the early signs of product-market fit.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Examples of this can be misalignment between product features and market demands, ineffecient product development processes and rising costs, leading to missed opportunities for ARR acceleration and market expansion when scaling.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			I provide <strong>fractional product & engineering leadership</strong> as well as strategic advisory tailored to scaling SaaS companies. Acting as embedded leader or advisor, I <strong>align product strategies with business goals</strong>, streamline <strong>product & engineering execution</strong>, and guide founders through key scaling decisions and help them <strong>transform while we perform</strong>.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			By <strong>leveraging experience</strong> in this stage we can <strong>mitigate risks</strong>, drive <strong>functional excellence</strong>, and unlock <strong>growth potential</strong>. Using my experience in product & engineering leadership from previous scaling journeys, I support founders and the team in <strong>building scalable, successful SaaS businesses</strong>. For investors, this means <strong>less risk, a faster ARR growth, and a a more smooth path to maximizing ROI</strong>.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Let&apos;s unlock the full potential of your SaaS company together.
