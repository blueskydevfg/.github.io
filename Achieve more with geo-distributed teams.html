		<h2>How I Can Help You Achieve More with Geo-Distributed Teams</h2>
		  <p>
			<strong>Scaling</strong> your software organization with <strong>nearshore or offshore teams</strong> can open doors to larger, <strong>cost-effective talent pool</strong> which can help your organization achieve <strong>faster growth, and greater efficiency</strong>. However working <strong>cross-culturally and cross-location</strong> comes with its own <strong>challenges</strong>. You might have <strong>concerns</strong> about <strong>maintaining productivity</strong>, aligning people with your <strong>empowered nordic culture</strong> and that teams in other locations are <strong>just executing the simpler tasks</strong> and not truly integrated and innovating alongside you.
		  </p>
		  <p>These concerns are valid, and I can help you and your team tackle them.</p>
		  <p>
			I bring 20+ years of <strong>experience building and leading distributed teams</strong></strong> across Europe and Asia. I can help your team <strong>improve workflows</strong> to connect people across locations, <strong>improve collaboration</strong>, and ensure your teams are <strong>not only productive but deeply engaged</strong>. I specialize in transforming teams and processes, improving cross-location collaboration, and aligning distributed teams with business goals. I ensure minimal disruption while <strong>delivering long-term improvements in team engagement, productivity, and knowledge-sharing</strong>.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Let&apos;s work together to make your geo-distributed teams achieve more and your organization scale better.

        <div class="pillar">
          <h3>ü§ù Fractional Role</h3>
          <p>As fractional product & engineering leader, I take on a time-bound part-time role in your organization to lead the needed transformations and improvements together with you and your team.</p>
          <p>We enter into an agreement about 2-3 days per week for a period of 3-6 months. The engagement is centered around goals you have already defined, that you want to achieve with the transformations.</p>
          <p>This is a good engagement form when you have a clear vision for what you want to achieve with the teams, but currently do not have the resources or people to drive that change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar">
          <h3>üåü Advisory and Consulting</h3>
          <p>I leverage my experience to provide sparring to your and your teams on an on-demand approach. The topics can vary depending on the needs at the given time. It can for example be review and suggestions for processes. Coaching and sparring etc.</p>
          <p>We enter into a frame agreement based on an expected number of advisory days you need within the next 3 months. We coordinate the upcoming days with one week notice.</p>
          <p>This is a good engagement form for when you only need ad hoc support or as a good - low commitment - way to start when you are uncertain about how you should improve.</p>
